# Resume
My Resume because copying these 2 files between computers is harder than using git.

You are welcome to use these files at your own risk.

And yes I shamelessly stole the .cls file from the internet, it makes life easy though

Note: My resume (the .tex file) was never meant to be read by others, don't complain if it's messy
